			"theme": "This surah is seen to be a precise table of contents of the Quranic message. It is very important in Islamic worship, being an obligatory part of the daily prayer, repeated several times during the day. It is a prayer and its answer. Al-Fatihah is the prayer from the servant and the Quran is the answer from the Master to his prayer. The servant prays to Allah to show him guidance and the Master places the whole of the Quran before him in answer to his prayer.",

			"context": "The greater part of Al-Baqarah was revealed during the first two years of the Prophet's (SAWS) life at Medina. The smaller part which was revealed at a later period has been included in this surah because its contents are closely related to those dealt with in this surah. Whereas in Makkah the Prophet (SAWS) was dealing with open hostility and clear disbelief, in Medina he was dealing with the Jews and Hypocrites now in Medina.",
			"theme": "The surah opens with a response to the plea for guidance in Surah 1, ‘The Opening’, dividing mankind into three groups in their response to this guidance – the believers, the disbelievers, and the hypocrites – and closes confirming the tenets of faith given in the opening verses. The addressee shifts as the surah progresses: at various times the text addresses mankind in general where they are urged to serve Allah who has been so gracious to them (they are reminded that Allah created Adam (AS) and favoured him over the angels), the Children of Israel, who are reminded of Allah’s special favours to them and urged to believe in scriptures that do indeed confirm their own, and the believers, who are given instruction in many areas –prayer, fasting, pilgrimage, defence, marital law, and financial matters.",
