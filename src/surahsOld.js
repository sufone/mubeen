He instructed Ali (رضي الله عنه‎) to deliver the discourse before the representatives of the different clans of Arabia so as to inform them of the new policy towards the Disbelievers.• The second discourse (vv., 38-72) was sent down in Rajab A.H. 9 or a little before this, when the Prophet (ﷺ) was engaged in making preparations for the Campaign of Tabuk. In this discourse, the Believers were urged to take active part in Jihad, and the shirkers were severely rebuked for holding back their wealth and for hesitation to sacrifice their lives in the way of Allah because of their hypocrisy, weak faith or negligence.• The third discourse (vv. 73-129) was revealed on his return from the Campaign of Tabuk. This discourse warns the Hypocrites of their evil deeds and rebukes those Believers who had stayed behind in the Campaign of Tabuk. Then after taking them to task, Allah pardons those true Believers who had not taken part in the Jihad in the way of Allah for one reason or the other.",
