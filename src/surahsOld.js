The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, 'Surah Hud and the like surahs have made me old.'

In this surah we have the stories of prophets. Theere are many stories of past prophets Nuh, Salih, Hud, Lut, Shu’ayb and Moosa (عليهم السلام).

The story of Yusuf (عليه السلام) is framed by a three-verse introduction and a 10 verse epilogue. It was revealed in a year that is known as the Year of Sorrow when the Prophet (ﷺ) lost two of his closest supporters, his uncle Abu Talib and his beloved wife Khadijah. During the time of Yusuf (عليه السلام) the ruling dynasty were a foreign Arab peoples from Syria known as the Amalekites and had the ruling Hyksos kings (with no pharaoh as they had their own religion), hence Yusuf’s (عليه السلام) relative ease of integration. The Hyksos ruled over Egypt up to the end of the fifteenth century B. C. and practically all the powers remained in the hands of the Israelites. Then there arose a great nationalist movement which overthrew the power of this dynasty and exiled 250,000 or so of the Amalekites. As a result of this, a very bigoted dynasty of Copts came into power and uprooted everything connected with the Amalekites. Then started that persecution of the Israelites which has been mentioned in connection with the story of Prophet Moosa (عليه السلام). ",
