The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, 'Surah Hud and the like surahs have made me old.'

In this surah we have the stories of prophets. Theere are many stories of past prophets Nuh, Salih, Hud, Lut, Shu’ayb and Moosa (عليهم السلام).

The story of Yusuf (عليه السلام) is framed by a three-verse introduction and a 10 verse epilogue. It was revealed in a year that is known as the Year of Sorrow when the Prophet (ﷺ) lost two of his closest supporters, his uncle Abu Talib and his beloved wife Khadijah. During the time of Yusuf (عليه السلام) the ruling dynasty were a foreign Arab peoples from Syria known as the Amalekites and had the ruling Hyksos kings (with no pharaoh as they had their own religion), hence Yusuf’s (عليه السلام) relative ease of integration. The Hyksos ruled over Egypt up to the end of the fifteenth century B. C. and practically all the powers remained in the hands of the Israelites. Then there arose a great nationalist movement which overthrew the power of this dynasty and exiled 250,000 or so of the Amalekites. As a result of this, a very bigoted dynasty of Copts came into power and uprooted everything connected with the Amalekites. Then started that persecution of the Israelites which has been mentioned in connection with the story of Prophet Moosa (عليه السلام). ",

Therefore, they might even have been praying for and expecting divine permission to wage war against those tyrants who had expelled them from their homes and deprived them of visiting the House of Allah and made it difficult for them to follow the way of Islam. It was at this psychological occasion that these verses were sent down in Medina. That is why the purpose for which Masjid-al-Haram was built has been specifically mentioned. It has been made plain that Hajj had been enjoined for the worship of Allah alone. But it is an irony that afterwards it had been dedicated to the rituals of shirk and the worshipers of Allah alone had been debarred from visiting it. Therefore, permission for waging war against those tyrants has been given to oust them from there and to establish the righteous way of life for establishing virtue and eradicating evil. ",

D – the date of revelation and the same time of the first migration to Abbysinia which was an ally of the Byzantium Empire at the time. Pagan Arabs were mocking the situation claiming idolatry was defeating revealed religion, particularly after Chosroes captured Jerusalem massacaring Christians and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Even seven to eight years after this prediction of the Qur’an, the conditions were such that no one could even imagine that the Byzantine Empire would ever gain an upper hand over Persia. Not to speak of gaining domination, no one could hope that the Empire, under the circumstances, would even survive. However Byzantine emperor Heraclius in 624 had attacked Persia and destroyed the birthplace of Zoroaster and ravaged the principal Fire temple of Persia. This was the very year when the Muslims achieved a decisive victory at Badr for the first time against the Disbelievers. Thus, both the predictions made in Surah Room were fulfilled simultaneously within the stipulated period of ten years. At the battle at Nineveh in 627 A.D. they dealt them the hardest blow to Persia which signalled the fulfilment of the prediction of the Qur’an. This was the year when the peace Treaty of Hudaybiyyah was concluded, which the Qur’an has termed as \"the supreme victory\". In 628 A. D., the Emperor himself went to Jerusalem to install the \"Holy Cross\" in its place, and in the same year the Prophet (ﷺ) entered Makkah for the first time after the Hijrah to perform the `Umra-tul-Qada'.
