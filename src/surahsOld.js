The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, 'Surah Hud and the like surahs have made me old.'

In this surah we have the stories of prophets. Theere are many stories of past prophets Nuh, Salih, Hud, Lut, Shu’ayb and Moosa (عليهم السلام).

The story of Yusuf (عليه السلام) is framed by a three-verse introduction and a 10 verse epilogue. It was revealed in a year that is known as the Year of Sorrow when the Prophet (ﷺ) lost two of his closest supporters, his uncle Abu Talib and his beloved wife Khadijah. During the time of Yusuf (عليه السلام) the ruling dynasty were a foreign Arab peoples from Syria known as the Amalekites and had the ruling Hyksos kings (with no pharaoh as they had their own religion), hence Yusuf’s (عليه السلام) relative ease of integration. The Hyksos ruled over Egypt up to the end of the fifteenth century B. C. and practically all the powers remained in the hands of the Israelites. Then there arose a great nationalist movement which overthrew the power of this dynasty and exiled 250,000 or so of the Amalekites. As a result of this, a very bigoted dynasty of Copts came into power and uprooted everything connected with the Amalekites. Then started that persecution of the Israelites which has been mentioned in connection with the story of Prophet Moosa (عليه السلام). ",

Therefore, they might even have been praying for and expecting divine permission to wage war against those tyrants who had expelled them from their homes and deprived them of visiting the House of Allah and made it difficult for them to follow the way of Islam. It was at this psychological occasion that these verses were sent down in Medina. That is why the purpose for which Masjid-al-Haram was built has been specifically mentioned. It has been made plain that Hajj had been enjoined for the worship of Allah alone. But it is an irony that afterwards it had been dedicated to the rituals of shirk and the worshipers of Allah alone had been debarred from visiting it. Therefore, permission for waging war against those tyrants has been given to oust them from there and to establish the righteous way of life for establishing virtue and eradicating evil. ",

D – the date of revelation and the same time of the first migration to Abbysinia which was an ally of the Byzantium Empire at the time. Pagan Arabs were mocking the situation claiming idolatry was defeating revealed religion, particularly after Chosroes captured Jerusalem massacaring Christians and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Even seven to eight years after this prediction of the Qur’an, the conditions were such that no one could even imagine that the Byzantine Empire would ever gain an upper hand over Persia. Not to speak of gaining domination, no one could hope that the Empire, under the circumstances, would even survive. However Byzantine emperor Heraclius in 624 had attacked Persia and destroyed the birthplace of Zoroaster and ravaged the principal Fire temple of Persia. This was the very year when the Muslims achieved a decisive victory at Badr for the first time against the Disbelievers. Thus, both the predictions made in Surah Room were fulfilled simultaneously within the stipulated period of ten years. At the battle at Nineveh in 627 A.D. they dealt them the hardest blow to Persia which signalled the fulfilment of the prediction of the Qur’an. This was the year when the peace Treaty of Hudaybiyyah was concluded, which the Qur’an has termed as \"the supreme victory\". In 628 A. D., the Emperor himself went to Jerusalem to install the \"Holy Cross\" in its place, and in the same year the Prophet (ﷺ) entered Makkah for the first time after the Hijrah to perform the `Umra-tul-Qada'.

The Disbelievers of Makkah at that time were engaged in two kinds of the activities against the Prophet (ﷺ). First, they were disputing the Qur’an and Messenger creating every kind of suspicion and misgiving in the minds of the people. Second, they were preparing the ground for putting an end to the Prophet (ﷺ) himself, for example one day when the Prophet (ﷺ) was offering his prayer in the precincts of the Ka’bah, suddenly 'Uqbah bin Abi Mu'ait, rushed forward and putting a piece of cloth round his neck started twisting it so as to strangle him to death. Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه‎), who happened to go there in time, pushed him away. Abdullah (رضي الله عنه‎) says that when Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه‎) was struggling with the cruel man, he was saying words to the effect: \"Would you kill a man only because he says: Allah is my Lord?\" which mirrors the sayings of the secret believer in this surah.",

The central section of the surah deals with the story of Pharaoh and Moosa (عليه السلام): the destruction of one and victory of the other. The Prophet (ﷺ) is, in his turn, urged to be steadfast and to ignore the taunts of the Disbelievers.",

During the boycott and persecution and the year of sorrow, the Prophet (ﷺ) went to Ta’if but was rejected, on his way back he stayed at Makkah where during one night a group of the Jinn happened to pass by and listened to the Qur'an, believed in it, and returned to their people to preach Islam. Thus, Allah gave His Prophet (ﷺ) the good news that if the men were running away from his invitation, there were many of the Jinn, who had become its Believers, and they were spreading his message among their own kind.

		    "context": "This was revealed in Dhil-Qadah, A. H. 6, at a time when the Prophet (ﷺ) was on his return journey to Medina after concluding the Truce of Hudaybiyyah with the Disbelievers of Makkah. Upon the Prophet (ﷺ) seeing a divine dream of umrah, he set out with his companions to Makkah despite its dangers. By going in a forbidden month, the Quraysh were hesitant to attack and tribe to provoke the defenceless Muslims and gain allies among the Arab tribes but failed as they were indeed only pilgrims. However, when Uthman (رضي الله عنه‎) was sent as a messenger to the Quraysh he was captured in the city, and then rumours of him being killed made the Muslims make the Pledge of Ridwan to fight to death. However, he came back and peace was negotiated at Hudaybiyyah, a great success (Al Fath) for Muslims in the long term but the Muslims felt humiliated in the short term. This treaty was made as the Muslims had set out to perform pilgrimage, and the Makkans decided to bar them at Hudaybiyyah from reaching the town and sent emissaries to have discussions with the Prophet (ﷺ). In the end the Prophet (ﷺ) signed a treaty that he and the Believers would not enter Makkah that year but would do so the next year. Seeing the long-term significance of this treaty, in the interests of peace he agreed to a truce of ten years during which time, if any Makkan went over to his side, he would return him to the Makkans, but if any of his people went over to the Makkans, they would not return them. The treaty made the Muslims: a recognised state from Arabs, able to perform pilgrimage, focus on other threat such as the Jews and Hypocrites and gave time to spread Islam across Arabia. It was all due to this treaty that two years later when in consequence of the Quraysh's violating the treaty the Prophet (ﷺ) invaded Makkah, he was accompanied by an army 10,000 strong, whereas on the occasion of Hudaybiyyah only 1,400 men had joined him in the march.    ",
		    "theme": "Throughout the surah the Prophet (ﷺ) is assured that this treaty that Allah has given him is a great breakthrough (cf. verses 1–3, 18–21, 27). The Believers are reassured that their self-restraint and obedience to the Prophet (ﷺ) were inspired by Allah. The surah condemns both the Hypocrites in Medina and the idolaters of Makkah and closes by praising the Believers. The surah talks about the moral and physical victory of Islam over the forces of unbelief.  The Hypocrites and Disbelievers will be disappointed with this victory.",

H. 9. Likewise, about verse 6 a large number of the traditions of Hadith confirm that it was sent down concerning Walid bin Uqbah whom the Prophet (ﷺ) had sent to collect the zakat from the Bani al-Mustaliq, and it is well known that Walid bin Uqabah had become a Muslim on the conquest of Makkah.
