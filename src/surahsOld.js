			"name": "The Fatiha is that which opens a subject or a book or any other thing",
			"period": "Makkan",
			"context": "The first complete surah revealed which was revealed to the Prophet (SAWS)",
			"theme": "This surah is seen to be a precise table of contents of the Quranic message. It is very important in Islamic worship, being an obligatory part of the daily prayer, repeated several times during the day. It is a prayer and its answer. Al-Fatihah is the prayer from the servant and the Quran is the answer from the Master to his prayer. The servant prays to Allah to show him guidance and the Master places the whole of the Quran before him in answer to his prayer.",

		"name": "al-Baqarah",
		"summary": {
			"name": "This is the longest in the Quran, containing material revealed over several years, and named after the story of the cow which the Israelites were ordered to slaughter (verses 67 onwards)",
			"period": "Medinan",
			"context": "The greater part of Al-Baqarah was revealed during the first two years of the Prophet's (SAWS) life at Medina. The smaller part which was revealed at a later period has been included in this surah because its contents are closely related to those dealt with in this surah. Whereas in Makkah the Prophet (SAWS) was dealing with open hostility and clear disbelief, in Medina he was dealing with the Jews and Hypocrites now in Medina.",
			"theme": "The surah opens with a response to the plea for guidance in Surah 1, ‘The Opening’, dividing mankind into three groups in their response to this guidance – the believers, the disbelievers, and the hypocrites – and closes confirming the tenets of faith given in the opening verses. The addressee shifts as the surah progresses: at various times the text addresses mankind in general where they are urged to serve Allah who has been so gracious to them (they are reminded that Allah created Adam (AS) and favoured him over the angels), the Children of Israel, who are reminded of Allah’s special favours to them and urged to believe in scriptures that do indeed confirm their own, and the believers, who are given instruction in many areas –prayer, fasting, pilgrimage, defence, marital law, and financial matters.",
			"breakdown": [
				{
					"name": "1 - 20: THE BOOK OF GUIDANCE",
					"details": "These introductory verses declare the Quran to be the Book of Guidance: enunciate the articles of the Faith -- belief in Allah, Prophethood and Life-after-death; divide mankind into three main groups with regard to its acceptance or rejection -- Believers, disbelievers and hypocrites."
				}, 
				{
					"name": "21 – 29: WORSHIP ALLAH ALONE",
					"details": "Allah invites mankind to accept the Guidance voluntarily and to submit and worship Him Alone, the Lord and the Creator of the Universe and to believe in the Quran, His Guidance, and in the Life-after-death."
				}, 
				{
					"name": "30 – 39: THE STORY OF ADAM (AS) AND ALLAH’S CONTINUING GUIDANCE",
					"details": "The story of the appointment of Adam (AS) as Allah's Vicegerent on Earth, of his life in the Garden, his status and Angels being ordered to prostrate to him, of his falling prey to the temptations of Satan, of his repentance and its acceptance, has been related to show to mankind (Adam's (AS) offspring), that the only right thing for them is to accept and follow the Guidance. This story also shows that the Guidance of Islam is the same that was given to Adam and that it is the original religion of mankind and Allah will always send guidance periodically through Prophets."
				}, 
				{
					"name": "40 – 120: THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND ALLAH’S GUIDANCE",
					"details": "In this portion invitation to the Guidance has particularly been extended to the children of Israel and their past and present attitude has been criticized to show that the cause of their degradation was their deviation from the Guidance and breaking their covenant with Allah.\nWhen finally entering Jerusalem the Children of Israel experienced great blessing as: Musa (AS) striked a rock supplying water for the 12 tribes of Israel, prayed for heavenly assistance from Allah via Manna and QuaIls, and gave miracles by resurrecting a dead man to settle a dispute between them regarding a cow that was killed which they were ordered to sacrifice but quarrelled with Musa (AS) on what type of cow.\nYet despite this they still disobeyed highlighted in them: worshipping the Calf in Musa (AS) absence, asking to see Allah, not being satisfied with Allah’s heavenly provision, breaking the Sabbath and disobeying and killing Prophets. Even after all this they were called by Allah to repentance and forgiveness.\nThere is also a warning to people not to follow magic which was taught by the Angels Harut and Marut in Babylon, yet was falsely attributed to Sulayman (AS) by the Shaytans. This was a reminder to the believers to learn from these examples of the folly of the People of the Book and to stick to the Prophet (SAWS) and the Quran."
				},
				{
					"name": "121 – 141: IBRAHIM (AS) AND THE BUILDING OF THE KAABAH",
					"details": "The Jews have been exhorted to follow Prophet Muhammad (SAWS) who had come with the same Guidance and who was a descendant and follower of Prophet Ibrahim (AS) (AS) whom they highly honoured as their ancestor, and professed to follow as a prophet. This is the religion of Ibrahim (AS) who was neither a Jew nor Christian. The story of the building of the Ka`abah by him and his son Isma’il (AS) has been mentioned because it was going to be made the qiblah of the Muslim Community.The Jews were not present whenYa’qub (AS) commanded his sons to worship Allah on his deathbed but later generations turned to polytheism."
				}, 
				{
					"name": "142 – 152: A NEW QIBLAH",
					"details": "In this portion, the declaration of the change of qiblah from the Bayt ul Maqdis (Jerusalem) to the Ka`bah (Makkah) has been made as a symbol of the change of leadership from the children of Israel to the Muslim Community, which has also been fore-warned to guard against those transgressions against the Guidance that had led to the deposition of the Jews."
				},
				{
					"name": "153 – 243: LAWS AND REGULATIONS FOR THE BELIEVERS",
					"details": "Salat, Sawm, Zakat, Haj and Jihad have been prescribed for the moral training of the Ummat. The Believers have been exhorted to obey authority, to be just, to fulfill pledges, to observe treaties, to spend wealth etc., in the way of Allah. Laws, rules, punishments and regulations have been laid down for their organization, cohesion and conduct of day-to-day life and for the solution of social, economic, political and international problems; on the other hand, drinking, gambling, lending money on interest etc., have been prohibited to keep the Ummat safe from disintegration. In between these, the basic articles of the Faith have been reiterated at suitable places, particularly what true piety and righteousness entails, for these alone can enable and support one to stick to the Guidance. Mankind used to be one nation but divisions came later; Allah promises to always send His Guidance and warns not to follow Satan."
				}, 
				{
					"name": "243 – 254: FIGHTING IN THE CAUSE OF ALLAH",
					"details": "Fighting in the cause of Allah, the outer jihad, is illustrated when a prophet of the Children of Israel ordered them to follow King Saul and to fight with him, yet they were weary of following him despite the Ark of the Covenant coming down as his proof of leadership. As a test from Allah when the army of Saul reached a river only those who knew that they would meet Allah did not drink from it, but many did. So the small army of believers now reached Goliath outnumbered but the young prophet Dawud (AS) slayed Goliath and took over Saul’s kingdom showing reliance on Allah gives victory. Allah asks who will give him the best loan which means striving for the cause of Allah by which He will multiply as He wills in the hereafter."
				},
				{
					"name": "255: THE VERSE OF THE THRONE",
					"details": "The famous verse of the throne (Ayat-ul-Kursi) is illustrated magnificently here showing Allah’s grandeur and power through a number of his attributes"
				}, 
				{
					"name": "256 – 260: ALLAH’S MIRACLES",
					"details": "This starts with the premise of there being no compulsion in religion. The narration of the story of Ibrahim (AS) interaction with King Nimrod who thought himself Allah but was dumbfounded with his logic, and then the one who Allah made die for 100 years (possibly Prophet Ezra) and then brought him back to life without him knowing how long he had gone for showing Allah’s power, and then Allah showing Ibrahim (AS) the miracle of bringing the four birds back to him after they had scattered. All stories illustrate how Allah brings things back to life"
				},
				{
					"name": "261 – 283: ALLAH BLESSES CHARITY AND PROHIBITS USURY",
					"details": "The Believers have been exhorted to spend in the way of Allah in order to please Him alone. In contrast to this, they have been warned against the evils of lending money on interest. Instructions have also been given for the honest conduct of day-to-day business transactions."
				}, 
				{
					"name": "284 – 286: THE PRAYER OF THE BELIEVERS",
					"details": "The basic articles of the faith have been recapitulated here at the end of the surah, just as they were enunciated at its beginning. Then the surah ends with a prayer which the Muslim Community needed very much at that time when they were encountering untold hardships in the propagation of the guidance."
